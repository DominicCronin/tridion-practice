# Introduction #

Of course, you can reverse-engineer who did what by checking the logs, but by default, Google Code displays the name of the last person to touch a page, which may be misleading.  Here is a simplified list of the contributors so far.  Even this list might be misleading, as it really only covers who put the material in the wiki. If some contributions were originally written by someone else, they might not get the credit here, but it doesn't mean we aren't grateful anyway. If you think you should be credited here for something, please let us know. In general the first person to put a page in the wiki is credited as the original author. People who make later edits get credit for an "assist". It ain't perfect, but hey...
